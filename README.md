------------------------------------------------
The PHP Mentoring organization is designed to help foster good mentorship relationships and bring people together.  The mentorships repository is the place to go for information on current mentors, apprentices, and mentorship pairs.  Other repositories will (eventually) hold PHP best practices, extensions tutorials, and other information for helping developers grow, even resources for becoming an excellent mentor.
